# Sage Vite

Given the limitations I encountered with Bud on Windows, and considering that WSL isn't feasible for my setup, I decided to explore Vite as an alternative.
Please note that this is might not be the best solution for you.
Dropped support for guttenberg due to most of my work are using Classic Editor. I'm not sure if I'll be able to support guttenberg in the near future, a pull request is welcome.
